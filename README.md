## What is Mad Libs

You might have played it before where it is a word game that consists of a player prompting others for a list of words to fill in the blanks of a story before reading it outloud. In this project you will be using functions to create stories (or a custom one) and prompting users (yourself or others) to enter input based on the story. These inputs could be adjectives, nouns, verbs, vehicles, food items, etc.
